 * @brief This file contains private functions and declarations related to the
 *        game module.
 *
 * The file includes necessary header files for board and player types from the
 * common module. It defines various helper functions used internally by the
 * game module to facilitate gameplay and manage game state.
 *
 * The functions in this file are responsible for tasks such as handling user
 * input, validating usernames, creating and managing players, sorting players
 * based on dice rolls, building and printing the game board, checking player
 * positions, updating scores, and determining the winner of the game.
 *
 * @note The functions in this file are intended for internal use within the
 *       game module and should not be accessed or called directly from outside
 *       the module.
 *
 * @warning Modifying or calling these functions without proper understanding of
 *          their implementation may result in unexpected behavior and errors in
 *          the game module.
